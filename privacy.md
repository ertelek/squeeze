# Privacy Policy — Squeeze!

**Effective date:** 21st October, 2025  
**Developer:** Evans Ehiorobo (“we”, “us”, “our”)  
**Contact:** contact.ertelek@yahoo.com

Squeeze! (“the App”) helps you compress videos stored on your device. We designed it to work **locally on your device**. We do not run an account system and we do not send your personal data to our servers.

## 1) Data collection
- **No personal data collected:** We do not collect names, email addresses, identifiers, or location.  
- **No analytics or tracking:** We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.  
- **No uploads to our servers:** Video files and folders are processed entirely on device.

## 2) What the App does on your device
To compress your videos, the App may:
- **Scan selected folders** (or all of internal storage if you choose that mode) to find video files.  
- **Read & write video files** to create compressed copies or replace originals based on your settings.  
- **Move or delete files** if you disable “Keep original files,” or when performing in-place compression.  
- **Show notifications** while compression runs in the background.

All of this happens **locally**; the App does not transmit your files outside your device.

## 3) Permissions we request and why
Depending on your Android version and choices, the App may request:

- **Photos and Videos**  
  Purpose: Allow reading and writing photos and videos to locate and compress videos. Without this, some features may not work.

- **Notifications**  
  Purpose: Show progress, pause/resume, and completion status during background compression.

We request only the permissions necessary for the features you enable, and we use them solely for compression functionality.

## 4) How we use your information
- We **do not** collect, sell, share, or monetize personal information.  
- File paths and job status are stored **on your device** to resume compression and display progress.  
- If you opt to replace originals, the App may **delete** them per your setting.

## 5) Data sharing
- We **do not share** your data with third parties.  
- The App uses open-source components (e.g., FFmpeg) operating locally on your device; these libraries do not transmit your files.

## 6) Data retention and deletion
- **Job state and options** are stored locally and remain until you clear app data or uninstall.  
- **Compressed videos** remain on your device until you delete them.  
- **Original videos** may be retained (if you enable “Keep original files”) or removed per your settings.  
- Uninstalling the App removes its local settings and cache but does not delete your personal media files unless you have chosen to replace originals during use.

## 7) Security
- Processing is on-device, so there is no server exposure.  
- Please set a device screen lock and keep your OS up to date to protect files on your device.

## 8) Children’s privacy
The App is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 9) International use & transfers
We do not transfer your data internationally because we do not collect or transmit it in the first place.

## 10) Your choices
- You can **deny permissions**; the App will limit functionality accordingly.  
- You can **change settings** at any time (e.g., keep originals vs replace, folder scope).  
- You can **uninstall** the App to remove its local settings and stop processing.

## 11) Changes to this policy
We may update this policy for legal or feature changes. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective date”.
